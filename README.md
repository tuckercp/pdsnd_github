## Exploring US Bikeshare Data with Python

### Date created
This project was created on 08/21/23. Edited on 08/27/23.

### Description
This project explores bike sharing data for 3 major US cities; Chicago, New York and Washington D.C. The program aims to provide users with a complete, interactive experience through Python and its library Pandas. Users will select a city and then have the ability to apply various filters to the data, i.e. by month, day, type of user, gender and/or birth year. The program will then provide various statistics based on those filters, such as the most and least popular times of travel, starting stations and ending stations, the average and total trip duration, as well as various user info such as the number of riders based on user type, gender and birth year. Finally, users will have the option to view raw data and individual rides, and/or reset the data to view a different city.
