# Exploring US Bikeshare Data with Python

This project is part of the Udacity Programming for Data Science Nanodegree.  The purpose of this project is to use Python along with NumPy and Pandas to explore bikesharing data for 3 major US cities during the first 6 months of 2017.

### Description
---- 
This project investigates bike sharing data for Chicago, New York and Washington D.C. The program aims to provide users with a complete, interactive experience through Python and its libraries NumPy and Pandas. Users will select a city and then have the ability to apply various filters to the data, i.e. by month, day, type of user, gender and/or birth year. The program will then provide various statistics based on those filters, such as the most and least popular times of travel, starting stations and ending stations, the average and total trip duration, as well as various user info such as the number of riders based on user type, gender and birth year. Finally, users will have the option to view raw data and individual rides, and/or reset the data to view a different city.

### Technologies
---- 
* Python (specifically NumPy and Pandas)

### Getting Started
---- 
To run this project, install the following:
* import NumPy
* import Pandas

### Files Used
---- 
bikesharart.py
